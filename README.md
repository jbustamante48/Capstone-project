This repository consists of the source code for both components of my capstone project for my masters of science in data science. The first component is a logistic regression model that was created to make predictions of fraudulent credit card transactions using synthesized credit card transaction data. The second component is the source code to my analytics dashboard which consists of interactive graphs of the credit card data and key variables. The purpose of the dashboard is to provide the user with insights into transaction trends as they relate to being flagged as fraudulent or legitimate.
